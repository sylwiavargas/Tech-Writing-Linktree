# Tech Writing Linktree

I was sad to see the current linktree setup doesn't allow me to categorize my links. I built a linktree-like page for myself to host my tech writing portfolio. The page is responsive and light (html/css only)

✨ Feel free to use it as a template! ✨

## Getting started

- fork this repo and clone it
- in the `index.html` file change:
  - the metatags so that they link to your profile picutres, twitter page, etc.,
  - headers and links
- in the `styles.css` file change colors and whatever else your soul wishes
- deploy! I usually deploy such projects on [netlify](netlify.com) or [surge](surge.sh) because it takes very little time
